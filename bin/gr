# up the file hierarchy until it finds gradlew, and then executes it.
# It also looks for a build.gradle file and execute with that as the current directory.
#
# It makes it a bit simpler to execute gradlew when you are not located in the root of the project
#
# To use it simply copy it to somewhere on your path.
# If you want to run gradle with remote debug enabled use -d as the first argument
